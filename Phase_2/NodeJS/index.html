            <h4> Full Stack web Development utilizes: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API, NodeJS, ExpressJs and MySQL (These are some of the options)</h4>
            <h2>Node.JS is an environment that is designed to be run outside the browser (server-side). It is an open source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.</h2>
            <h4>NEW FILE: package.json contains dependencies</h4>
            <h4><code>npm i</code> installs the dependencies/node packages defined in the package.json file</h4>
            <h5>Those packages are used and installed by node as a different way to utilize them instead of using a CDN link</h5>
            <h4><code>node index</code> executes the appplication (extention note required)</h4>

            <h1>ES6: Version of JavaScript</h1>
            <h3>Arrow functions, let, and const, functional loops and template literals.</h3>
            <h5>NodeJS utilize ES6 syntax</h5>
            <h3>Open the console log and look at the script.js file</h3>
            <h3>Let: keyword to create a variable that is blocked scoped (enclosed in curly braces)</h3>
            <h3>While loop: will continue to iterate untill whatever logic it contains ends or stops being true</h3>
            <h3>Const: another way to create a variable, that we know should never be changed</h3>
            <h4>variables can be reassigned but not const</h4>
            <h4>We can create a const array and still add more values to it (these are true for primitive data types, like objects and arrays)</h4>
            <h4>Similarly, we can change the data type of the key-value pairs of an object, as we are not reassigning the object, just updating it</h4>
            <h3>Functional loops:
                <ul>
                    <li>forEach is used to loop thru values in an array or array of objects;</li>
                    <li>filter returns a new array that contains the elements whose callback returns a 'truthy' value</li>
                    <li>map returns a new array with the same length as the original array after each element is passed thru a callback function</li>
                </ul>
            </h3>
            <h4>spread syntax (...) allows us to iterate over a value in arrays and expand on it</h4>

        <h3><code>process.argv</code> In node.js, we store command line arguments in an object property</h3>
        <h5> <code>console.log(process.argv[2])</code>  will output "Hello" if command line prompt is <code>"node index.js Hello World"</code> , since "Hello" has an index value of 2</h5> 
        <h3>Ternary operator: a short cut way to write if else statment would be  </h3>   
        <code>a === b ? true : false</code>
        <h5>The logic before the question mark is check if true; if it is return whatever is after the question mark; else, return whatever is after the colon :</h5>

        <h1>Node Packages</h1>
        <h3>To access any node package we have to
            <ol>
                <li>We have to list the package (if applicable) in the package.json file and then install them (using <code> npm i</code>)</li>
                <br>
                <li>We have to let the application know that we will be using that package, for example by writing <code> const fs = require('fs')</code></li>
                <br>
            </ol>
        </h3>
        <h2>FS - file system availble at run time (part of the node library)</h2>
        <h4>readFile is a built in method for accessing and reading the contents of a file.</h4>
        <code>fs.readFile('path to the file', 'encoding type (usually utf8)', function)</code>
        <br>
        <h4>writeFile is another method coming from the fs package for creating a file if it doesn't exist, or replaces the content of an existing file</h4>
        <code>fs.writeFile('name of the file', 'content to be written into the file', function)</code>
        <br>
        <h4>appendFile is another method coming from the fs package for creating a file if it doesn't exist, or adds additional content to an existing file</h4>
        <code>fs.appendFile('path of the file', 'content to be added into the file', function)</code>

        <h1>Modularization</h1>
        <h3>Modularization is the activity of dividing a product or system into interchangeable modules.</h3>
        <h4>We can use custom JavaScript files as dependencies for our code</h4>
        <br>
        <h3>We can write custom code in a JavaScript file and then call on it to access that code</h3>
        <h4>We would require it (i.e. <code>const custom = require('path to custom script')</code>)</h4>
        <h4>Also, in the custom script file we need to export the code using <code> module.exports = { variables, functions, etc }</code></h4>

        <h1>Switch, case, break, default</h1>
        <h3>It is another way of writing an if else statement. When the keyword switch is invoked, we would supply it with a paramter that we would check if it is true or false.</h3>
        <h3>The we write case statements to check against the value of the parameter defined earlier. Lastly, when the logic is true, we must use break to exit that logic of the switch/case statement, otherwise we move on to the next statement.</h3>
        <h3>A default statement is needed at the end to account for a case not covered by each statement.</h3>
        <h4><code>Switch (parameter) { case 'value' : "do this" ; break; default: "do this instead" }</code></h4>
        <br>
        <h4><i>Note: default data type from command line is string, we can use <code>parseInt()</code> to convert these entries into numerical values</i></h4>

        <h1>Node Package Manager (npm)</h1>
        <h3>We can use npm init -y to initialize a folder to use node packages. This will install a package.json file. The -y is an optional parameter to answer yes to all questions</h3>
        <h3>One way to install a dependency, badmath for example, is to then run <code>npm i badmath</code></h3>
        <h3>Another way to install a dependency, is to creat your own package.json and list badmath with its version under dependencies, then run  <code>npm i</code></h3>
